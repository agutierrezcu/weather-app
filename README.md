# Weather App
A simple web application (SPA) to check weather forecast using react, redux, react-router, redux-saga, reselect, styled-component and son on....

## Overview

<a href="https://online.reacttraining.com/p/reactjsfundamentalsOne">React.js Fundamentals</a> was one of the first courses I enrolled in when I got into React ecosystem.
Overall, the course is aimed at beginners and cover basic concepts of both React and Javascript as well.

The last part of the course was develop a handy weather app but only using React. I developed an app that fullfilled the same functional requirements but not only using React. 
I took advantage of that and, besides React, I included a bunch of amaizing open source projects that get on well each other ;-).

The goal of the app is only academy and put into practice acquired skills.

IÂ´d like to make special reference to a really great project: <a href="https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate">react-boilerplate</a>.
